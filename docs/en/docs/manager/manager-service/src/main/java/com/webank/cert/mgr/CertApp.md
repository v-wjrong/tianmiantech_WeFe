```

This flowchart depicts the structure of an empty class named CertApp. The diagram contains only a single node representing the class itself, without any branches for attributes or methods, as this is an empty class framework yet to implement any functionality. The diagram clearly illustrates the basic form of the class, providing a visual starting point for future additions of class members (such as fields, constructors, methods, etc.). This minimal representation aligns with the current state of the code while preserving room for future expansion.
