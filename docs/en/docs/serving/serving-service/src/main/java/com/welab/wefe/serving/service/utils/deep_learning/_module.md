```mermaid
graph TD
    deep_learning
```

This flowchart displays a simple single-layer directory structure containing only the node "deep_learning". Since the provided path information consists of a single complete path with no sibling or subordinate files/directories, the generated flowchart only shows the terminal directory name "deep_learning". This indicates that the path points to an independent directory named deep_learning, and the current given path information does not reflect its hierarchical relationship with other directories or files.
