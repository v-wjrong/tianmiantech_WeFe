```

This flowchart illustrates the hierarchical structure of Cassandra-related code in the serving-service module of the WeFe project. The root node is the cassandra directory, which contains an implementation file named CassandraTemplate.java for handling Cassandra database operations. This concise tree structure exemplifies a typical code organization for a single-feature module, where the template file is placed directly under the feature directory.
