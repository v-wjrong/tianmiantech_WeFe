# Description

This is a Java class definition named Source, which contains a public string-type member variable named "database" initialized with a default value of "Unknown". This variable is used to store database information, with no specific database type currently specified. The class structure is simple, consisting solely of a field declaration without any defined methods. This design is typically used as a base class or placeholder, where functionality can later be extended through inheritance or direct modification of the field value. The entire class definition demonstrates the fundamental use of data encapsulation in object-oriented programming.

    class Source {
        +String database = "Unknown"
    }
```

This code defines a simple class named Source, which contains a public string field 'database' with a default value of "Unknown". The class does not define any methods and is solely used for storing data source information. The class diagram clearly displays the class's only public field, a structure typically employed for basic data containers or configuration classes. With no methods or additional attributes, this class has a singular functionality, making it suitable as a simple component within a larger system.
