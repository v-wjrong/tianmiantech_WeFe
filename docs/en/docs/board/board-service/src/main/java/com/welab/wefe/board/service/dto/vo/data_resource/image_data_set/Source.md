### UML Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Source {
        +String database = "Unknown"
    }
```

This code defines a simple `Source` class containing a public string field `database` with an initial value of "Unknown". The class does not define any methods and is solely used for storing data source information. The class diagram clearly displays the class's only member variable along with its visibility and default value. Such a structure is typically employed for basic data containers or configuration classes.


### Internal Method Call Graph

```mermaid

    A["Class Source"]
    B["Public attribute: String database = 'Unknown'"]

    A --> B
```

This code defines a simple class named Source, which contains only one public string attribute "database" with a default value of "Unknown". The flowchart clearly illustrates the dependency relationship between the class and its sole attribute, without any methods or other complex structures. The entire class structure is extremely simple, designed solely for storing a string value representing a database name, making it suitable for use as a basic data container.
