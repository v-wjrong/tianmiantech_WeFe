    A["Class UpdateApi"]
```

This flowchart depicts an empty class structure named UpdateApi. Since the class doesn't define any attributes or methods, the diagram only contains a single node representing the class itself. Such basic structure typically serves as a starting point for API update operations, where features like version control or request processing can be added later. The empty class design might be used to reserve interfaces or serve as a parent class for subclasses to implement specific functionalities.
