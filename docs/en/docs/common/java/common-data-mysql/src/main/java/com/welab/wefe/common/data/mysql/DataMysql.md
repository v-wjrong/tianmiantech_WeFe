    class DataMysql {
    }
```

This code defines an empty class named DataMysql, which currently contains no attributes or methods. Judging from the class name, it may be related to MySQL database operations, but the current implementation is merely a framework structure without reflecting specific functionalities. Subsequent development may require adding member methods such as database connection and query execution, as well as attributes like connection parameters, to achieve complete data access functionality.
