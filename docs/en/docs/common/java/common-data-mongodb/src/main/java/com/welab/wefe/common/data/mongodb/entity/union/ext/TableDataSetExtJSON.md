```

This class diagram illustrates an empty class structure named TableDataSetExtJSON. Currently, the class does not define any attributes or methods, serving solely as a framework, potentially intended for future extension of JSON data processing capabilities. Such foundational class designs are commonly found in system architectures requiring预留扩展点, providing a basic container for adding table data and JSON format conversion functionalities later. The "Ext" suffix in the class name implies its extensible nature, while "JSON" indicates its association with data serialization.
