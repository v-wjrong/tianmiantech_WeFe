| Brief Description | BloomFilterExtJSON is a public Java class that may be used to extend the JSON functionality of Bloom filters. |

# Description

BloomFilterExtJSON is a public Java class, currently implemented as an empty shell without any member variables or methods. The class name suggests it may be intended for extending JSON-related functionality of Bloom filters, but its specific purpose would need to be determined based on context or subsequent implementations. As a foundational class structure, it provides a framework for future functional extensions.

### UML Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BloomFilterExtJSON {
        // This is an empty BloomFilter extension JSON class, currently without any defined members or methods
        // Intended to implement JSON serialization/deserialization functionality for Bloom filters
    }
```

This class diagram presents an empty class structure named BloomFilterExtJSON. Judging by the class name, it may be designed to extend Bloom filter functionality, specifically for handling JSON-formatted data conversion. Currently, the class contains no fields or methods, but it may potentially include serialization/deserialization-related methods in the future to convert a Bloom filter's bit array and hash function configurations into JSON format or reconstruct Bloom filter states from JSON.
