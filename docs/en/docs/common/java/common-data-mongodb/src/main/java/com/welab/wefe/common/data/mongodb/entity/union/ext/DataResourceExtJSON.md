This flowchart depicts an empty class structure named DataResourceExtJSON. The diagram contains only a single node representing the class declaration, without displaying any attributes or methods since the original code defines this class as empty. Such structures are typically used as base classes or placeholders, which can later be extended through inheritance or expansion to add specific functionalities. Empty classes are commonly employed in framework design for marking particular types or serving as extension points.
