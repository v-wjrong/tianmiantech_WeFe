    }
```

This class diagram depicts an empty class named GlobalConfigFlag, which currently has no attributes or methods. Based on the class name, it might be intended to store global configuration flags, but the current implementation is empty and requires future functional extensions. Such classes typically serve as placeholders for configuration management and may later incorporate static configuration parameters or global state control methods.
