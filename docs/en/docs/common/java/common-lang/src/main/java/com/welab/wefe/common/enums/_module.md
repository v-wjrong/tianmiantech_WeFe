# Description

The code defines an enumeration type named `FilePublicLevel`, which includes three enum values: `Private` indicates the file is private, `Public` indicates the file is public, and `PublicWithMemberList` indicates the file is visible to specified members. The enumeration's comments clarify the specific purpose of `PublicWithMemberList`.

This flowchart illustrates the enum class file structure within the common-lang module of the WeFe project. The top-level node represents the "enums" directory, which contains a specific enum class file "FilePublicLevel.java". This structure is a typical organization method for enum types in enterprise-level Java projects, where related enum classes are centrally stored in the enums package to achieve better code management and maintainability.
